abstract = {Chromium (Cr) contamination poses serious threats to the environment and human health. Thus, batch and column experiments were performed to investigate hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] removal from solution and porous media using nanoscale zerovalent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) stabilized by sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Batch experiments indicated that the mass ratio of Fe/CMC = 1, the presence of 150–200 mg L−1 CMC and lower ionic strength led to optimum Cr (VI) removal in aqueous solution. Column experiments demonstrated that Cr (VI) removal was enhanced with decreasing solution pH and increasing CMC-NZVI concentration. The presence of CMC can increase Cr (VI) removal by NZVI in both aqueous solution and porous media by complexation precipitation of Cr (VI) compounds and better dispersion of NZVI. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that an appropriate amount of CMC supported the redox reaction of Cr (VI) and NZVI. The removal of Cr (VI) through columns was 20.8% and 88.5% under no additional CMC and optimized CMC content, respectively. However, Cr (VI) removal decreased to 64.6% under excessive CMC content. The CMC modified NZVI nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM techniques. These findings imply that CMC can be used as an effective stabilizer on NZVI which can in turn be applied for the efficient removal of Cr (VI) from industrial wastewater and groundwater.}

abstract = {Soil contamination due to chlorinated organics prompts an important environmental problem; however, the iron-based reduction materials and complicated ground environment are the main barriers to implementation and promotion of in situ soil remediation. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the reductants zero-valent iron (ZVI) and its activated carbon composite (AC-ZVI) in terms of their self-oxidation and selectivity in soil experiments. The results indicated that saturated moisture conditions were beneficial for degradation due to the dispersal of the pollutants from soil particles. Particularly, increasing the water/soil ratio to the over-saturated state would decrease the selectivity of ZVI and AC-ZVI. Meanwhile, increasing the reductant loading decreased the selectivity of ZVI and AC-ZVI, whereas the high initial concentration increased the selectivity of AC-ZVI. In addition, the self-oxidation of ZVI (3.0 ×10−3 h−1) is 4.2 times higher than that of AC-ZVI (0.7 ×10−3 h−1), and the selectivity of AC-ZVI (48%) is 6.9 times higher than that of ZVI (7%), which confirmed that AC-ZVI is a superior iron-based amendment in saturated moisture conditions. Therefore, this study provides a reliable and feasible evaluation method for in situ remediation process, and deepens the understanding of the effects of moisture contents.}

abstract = {Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) with modified surface via coating with organic stabilizers has been documented with enhanced colloidal stability and dispersity. Therefore, the expanded application potential and accompanying intrinsic exposure of such nanoparticle can be anticipated. In our study, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-stabilized NZVI (CNZVI) exerted minimized oxidative stress response and slower disruption of cell membrane integrity, resulting in mitigated cytotoxicity towards bacteria Agrobacterium sp. PH-08 as compared with the uncoated counterpart. The corrosive oxidation of both nanoparticles in oxygenic water provided a better understanding of coating effect. The decreased oxidative degradation of probe 4-chlorophenol with CNZVI than NZVI implicated a weaker oxidizing capacity, which might overweight massive adhesion-mediated redox damage and explain the different exposure outcome. However, enhanced evolution of iron oxide as well as the promoted production of hydrogen peroxide adversely demonstrated CMC-coating facilitated iron corrosion by oxygen, suggesting CMC was most likely to act as a radical scavenger and compete with organics or bacteria for oxidants. Moreover, XRD, XPS and TEM results showed that the spherical NZVI was oxidized to form needle-shaped iron oxide-hydroxide (γFeOOH) with no detectable oxidative stress for PH-08, alleviating worries regarding exotoxicological impact of iron nanotechnology.}

abstract  ="Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) has attracted much more attention for its potential applications in the fields of environmental contaminant remediation and detoxification. Generally{,} nZVI consists of a zero-valent iron (Fe0) core and an iron oxide shell structure. As the underlying Fe0 core and the surface oxide shell determine the physical and chemical properties of nZVI{,} the nature of the oxide shell inevitably affects the organic/inorganic pollutant removal performance of nZVI{,} which has not been reviewed previously. In this article{,} we first introduce the synthesis and the oxide shell formation mechanism of core–shell structured nZVI and then discuss various characterization techniques to reveal the structure and chemical composition of the oxide shell. Subsequently{,} we clarify the roles of the oxide shell in the organic contaminant degradation efficiency and the molecular oxygen activation performance of nZVI and also highlight the effect of the oxide shell on heavy metal removal (including As) with nZVI. In addition{,} we summarize some oxide shell modification strategies to enhance the capacity and longevity of nZVI. Finally{,} we discuss the impacts of typical natural groundwater constituents (e.g. cations{,} anions{,} organic ligands{,} and dissolved oxygen) on the reactivity of nZVI and point out some unresolved issues related to the oxide shell dependent contaminant removal properties of nZVI."}

abstract = {Zero-valent iron nanoparticles have poor chemical stability due to their intrinsic crystal structure and surface energy that greatly limit their practical applications. However, significant improvements can be made via preparation of iron nanoparticles in amorphous structure. In this study, we provide a facile strategy to prepare amorphous iron nanoparticles filled alginate matrix composites. Sodium alginate, as the biopolymer matrix of the composites, can successfully inhibit the crystallization of iron nanoparticles and control their formation. In the presence of the alginate matrix, the amorphous iron nanoparticles can be prepared and act as the fillers of the composites. In the stability experiment, the air-exposed composites still remained 89.7% capability under the atmosphere with a relative humidity of 45% at 15 °C for 30 days. The result demonstrated that the amorphous iron nanoparticles of the composites exhibited high stability. Hence, the amorphous iron nanoparticles filled alginate matrix composites are very promising to be used in many fields.}

   Abstract = {Iron molybdate (Fe-2(MoO4)(3)) was used as a novel heterogeneous
      catalyst to activate persulfate (S2O82-) for rhodamine B (RhB)
      degradation. Results indicated 10 mg/L RhB can be completely removed
      under the addition of 4 mM S2O82- and 0.4 g/L Fe-2(MoO4)(3) within 240
      min. Fe-2(MoO4)(3) can be repeatedly used for six cycles and showed high
      stability with Fe leaching amounts less than 2.9\% in each run. Possible
      catalytic mechanism was proposed as follows: RhB degradation
      intermediate products such as hydroxybenzene, quinone compounds and
      organic compound radicals acted as electron transfer agents to reduce
      Fe3+ to Fe2+, which reacted with persulfate to form Fe3+ creating the
      redox cycling of iron, the RhB and those intermediate products are
      oxidized directly by the molybdenum peroxo complexes which forming
      probably with MoO42- and persulfate, and the synergy between Fe3+ and
      MoO42- occurring the catalytic effect on the persulfate. Additionally,
      the major intermediates of RhB were identified according to GC/MS and
      the possible degradation pathway was proposed.},

   Abstract = {Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has recently gained great interest in the scientific community as in situ reagent for installation of permeable reactive barriers in aquifer systems, since nZVI is highly reactive with chlorinated compounds and may render them to harmless substances. However, nZVI has a high tendency to agglomerate and sediment; therefore it shows very limited transport ranges. One new approach to overcome the limited transport of nZVI in porous media is using a suited carrier colloid. In this study we tested mobility of a carbon colloid supported nZVI particle "Carbo-Iron Colloids" (CIC) with a mean size of 0.63 mu m in a column experiment of 40 cm length and an experiment in a two-dimensional (2D) aquifer test system with dimensions of 110x40x5 cm. Results show a breakthrough maximum of 82 % of the input concentration in the column experiment and 58 % in the 2D-aquifer test system. Detected residuals in porous media suggest a strong particle deposition in the first centimeters and few depositions in the porous media in the further travel path. Overall, this suggests a high mobility in porous media which might be a significant enhancement compared to bare or polyanionic stabilized nZVI.},

   Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of dilution on the mobility of magnetite nanoparticles surface coated with poly(acrylic acid) (PM). Transport experiments were conducted in a water-saturated sand-packed column for input nanoparticle solutions with total Fe concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 mg/L Particle size analysis of the synthesized nanoparticle solutions showed that PM provides good size stability for Fe concentrations as low as about 1 mg/L Time-moment analysis of the nanoparticle breakthrough curves, on the other hand, revealed that nanoparticle mass recovery from the column decreased consistently with dilution, with greater attenuation, sharper fronts and longer tails compared to that of the tracer. Particle size analysis of the eluted solutions shows that the nanoparticle size is negatively correlated with nanoparticle concentration. Modeling results suggest that the decrease in nanoparticle mobility with input concentration can be represented using a kinetic time-dependent deposition term with finite deposition capacity and a kinetic detachment term. For field applications, the increase in particle size and detachment resulting from dilution means reduced transport efficiency of nanoparticles and reaction potential with travel distance.

   Abstract = {Treatment of nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) with lower valent forms of sulfur compounds (sulfidation) has the potential to increase the selectivity and reactivity of nZVI with target contaminants and to decrease inter-particle aggregation for improving its mobility. These developments help in addressing some of the long-standing challenges associated with nZVI-based remediation treatments and are of great interest for in situ applications. Herein we report results from a field-scale project conducted at a contaminated site. Sulfidated nZVI (S-nZVI) was prepared on site by first synthesizing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized nZVI with sodium borohydride as a reductant and then sulfidating the nZVI suspension by adding sodium dithionite. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of CMC-S-nZVI, from synthesis barrels, confirms the presence of both discrete spherical nZVI-like particles (similar to 90 nm) as well as larger irregular structures (similar to 500 nm) comprising of iron sulfides. This CMC-S-nZVI suspension was gravity fed into a sandy material and monitored through multiple multi-level monitoring wells. Samples collected from upstream and downstream wells suggest very good radial and vertical iron distribution. TEM-EDS analysis from the recovered well samples also indicates the presence of both nZVI-like particles as well as the larger flake-like structures, similar to those found in the injected CMC-S-nZVI suspension. This study shows that S-nZVI stabilized with CMC can be safely synthesized on site and is highly mobile and stable in the subsurface, demonstrating for the first time the field applicability of S-nZVI.

   Abstract = {The rate reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) by metallic iron under a range of conditions was studied in batch systems. The chemical variables studied were the Cr(VI) concentration, hydrogen ion concentration and surface area of iron. The influence of ionic strength and mixing rate was also examined. The reaction kinetics were found to be dependent on hydrogen ion concentration, hexavalent chromium concentration and iron surface area and to adhere to the following kinetic expression. d[Cr(VI)]dt = −k[Cr(VI)]0.5[H+]0.5(Area). The rate constant was evaluated and found to have a value of 5.45 × 10−5 1 cm−2 min−1 over a wide range of conditions. The rate constant was found to increase as mixing rate increased up to a maximum value beyond which the rate was essentially independent of mixing. Increases in ionic strength were found to result in a rapid decrease in the rate constant at ionic strengths below 0.1 M. Further increases in ionic strength had no detectable impact on the rate constant. All rate determination studies were run in the mixing and ionic strength independent regions of these systems. Reaction stoichiometry was found to be, with one exception, independent of environmental conditions. In general, 1.33 mol of iron dissolved for each mol of Cr(VI) reduced. This highly efficient utilization of iron in the reduction suggests that hydrogen generated during iron dissolution may be acting as a reductant for the Cr(VI). The single parameter which influenced the reaction stoichiometry was the initial Cr(VI) concentration. The ratio of Cr(VI) reduced to iron dissolved increased rapidly as the Cr(VI) concentration increased. This observation was taken as being consistant with a surface interaction between the hexavalent chromium and some metastable hydrogen species at the iron surface.},

   Abstract = {To decrease aggregation and enhance the mobility of nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) used for in-situ groundwater remediation, the surface of such NZVI must be modified using organic stabilizers, which can provide electrostatic repulsion, and steric or electrosteric stabilization. However, the stability of the nanoparticles can also be affected by groundwater components such as cations and humic acid (HA). In this study, the effect of Ca(2+) on the colloidal stability of NZVI coated with three types of stabilizers (i.e., polyacrylic acid (PAA), Tween-20 and starch) was evaluated in the absence or presence of HA. Differing stability behavior was observed for different surface-modified NZVIs. The presence of Ca(2+) exerted a slight influence on the settling of NZVI modified with PAA or Tween-20, in the absence or presence of HA. However, the presence of Ca(2+) caused significant aggregation and sedimentation for starch-modified NZVI in the absence of HA, and induced an even higher degree of aggregation and sedimentation in the presence of HA. It is presumed that, in the absence of HA, starch-modified NZVI particles undergo attachment with each other via Ca(2+) complexation with the coated starch molecules on the surface of the particles, thus enhancing the aggregation and the following sedimentation of starch-modified NZVI. However, in the presence of HA, spectroscopic analysis of the starch-modified NZVI aggregates indicated that the bridging interaction of HA with Ca(2+) was the predominant mechanism for the enhanced aggregation.},

   Abstract = {Conventional coagulation kinetic models are usually based on Smoluchowski’s work, which employs the coalesced sphere assumption. Much evidence, however, has recently been provided that particle aggregates from natural waters and engineered systems have fractal structures. Consequently, the traditional models should be modified to include the fractal nature of aggregates. This paper describes a modeling approach that simulates changes in particle size distribution (PSD) due to coagulation by incorporating recently proposed fractal mathematics and introducing a new conceptual framework called the coalesced  fractal sphere (CFS) assumption. The developed modeling method, which includes the traditional Euclidean case as a subset, was applied to a 2-m settling column system with estuarine sediment particles, and a one-dimensional numerical model was developed. Model simulations were conducted varying the fractal dimension (  D  F) and the collision efficiency factor (  α). For the conventional Euclidean case, the model indicated that coagulation played an important role in the vertical transport of the estuarine sediment particles. The simulations with the fractal cases indicated that both  D  F and  α significantly affected the evolution of PSD, and that with lower values of  D  F and  α, the model predicted a trend of PSD similar to that of the Euclidean case. This finding may be interpreted as dependence of  α on the assumed collision models (or  D  F), that seems to leave a new challenge to our understanding of  α. The developed model may be used in various particle aggregation systems.},

   Abstract = {Palladium-doped nanosized zerovalent iron (Pd-NZVI) particles can contribute to the transformation of chlorinated solvents and various other contaminants into innocuous products. To make Pd-NZVI an effective in situ subsurface remediation agent, these particles need to migrate through a targeted contaminated area. However, previous studies have reported very limited mobility of these particles in the groundwater environment and attributed it to rapid aggregation and subsequent pore plugging. In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of selected natural and nontoxic organic macromolecules (carboxymethyl cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein) on the aggregation and transport behavior of bare and coated Pd-NZVI. Aggregation behavior was investigated using dynamic light scattering by monitoring the evolution of hydrodynamic diameter as a function of time, whereas transport behavior was investigated by conducting water-saturated sand-packed column experiments. While bare Pd-NZVI is prone to rapid aggregation, we observed good colloidal stability and concurrent enhanced transport of Pd-NZVI coated with carboxymethyl cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein. Each surface modifier performed well at lower ionic strength (IS) (10 mM NaHCO3), and one of the rhamnolipid surface modifiers (JBR215) significantly enhanced transport of 150 mg/L Pd-NZVI at concentrations as low as 10 mg/L total organic carbon. However, an increase in the solution IS induced significant Pd-NZVI aggregation with a simultaneous decrease in the transport potential in accordance with the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek) theory of colloidal stability. Nonetheless, at the highest IS (300 mM NaHCO3) investigated, the mobility of rhamnolipid-coated Pd-NZVI is significantly higher than that of Pd-NZVI coated with the other surface modifiers, suggesting that biosurfactants may be the most suitable surface modifiers in field application. Overall, this study emphasizes how stabilization of Pd-NZVI with natural macromolecules such as rhamnolipids can improve the transport potential of these reactive nanoparticles in subsurface remediation applications at concentrations significantly lower than those of other commonly used polymers.},

   Abstract = {Although several techniques have been proposed to predict permeability using porosity–permeability relationships, the Kozeny–Carmen (K–C) correlation is the most widely acceptable methodology in the oil industry. Amaefule et al. (1993) modified that correlation introducing the concept of Reservoir Quality Index (RQI) and Flow Zone Indicator (FZI) to enhance its capability to capture the various reservoir flow behavior based on its respective characters. Yet, there are challenges in using the original correlation due to its inherent limitations and over simplified assumptions that prevent accurate Hydraulic Flow Unit (HFU) definitions. This research addresses some of those shortcomings and proposes a modified K–C correlation by handling the tortuosity term in a more robust manner. Core data from major carbonate reservoirs in Saudi Arabia is used to test the model. Additional data sets obtained from literature on sandstone reservoirs are used as well to demonstrate the global applicability of the proposed model. Results show that more permeability variations are to be expected within a given HFU. Moreover, the conventional model underestimates permeability values within a specific HFU significantly in comparison with the new model.  ► Kozeny–Carmen equation ignores the inherent nonlinearity of tortuosity and porosity. ► Tortuosity is approximated from the formation resistivity and porosity. ► A novel permeability–porosity model is proposed. ► The proposed model captures the nonlinearity of tortuosity more efficiently. ► The conventional model underestimates permeability within a HFU.},

   Abstract = {Present and past anthropogenic pollution of the hydrosphere and lithosphere is a growing concern around the world for sustainable development and human health. Current industrial activity, abandoned contaminated plants and mining sites, and even everyday life is a pollution source for our environment. There is therefore a crucial need to clean industrial and municipal effluents and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater. Nanosized zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an emerging material in these fields due to its high reactivity and expected low impact on the environment due to iron’s high abundance in the earth crust. Currently, there is an intensive research to test the effectiveness of nZVI in contaminant removal processes from water and soil and to modify properties of this material in order to fulfill specific application requirements. The number of laboratory tests, field applications, and investigations for the environmental impact are strongly increasing. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the catalytic activity, reactivity and efficiency of nZVI in removing toxic organic and inorganic materials from water, wastewater, and soil and groundwater, as well as its toxic effect for microorganisms and plants.},

   Abstract = {Direct injection of reactive nanoscale zerovalent iron particles (NZVI) is considered to be a promising approach for remediation of aquifers contaminated by chlorinated organic pollutants. In this study we show that the extent of sulfidation of NZVI enhances the rate of dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) compared to that by unamended NZVI, and the enhancement depends on the Fe/S molar ratio. Experiments where TCE was reacted with NZVI sulfidated to different extents (Fe/S molar ratios 0.62-66) showed that the surface-area normalized first-order TCE degradation rate constant increased up to 40 folds compared to non-sulfidated NZVI. Fe/S ratios in the range of 12-25 provided the highest TCE dechlorination rates, and rates decreased at both higher and lower Fe/S. In contrast, sulfidated NZVI exposed to water in the absence of TCE showed significantly lower hydrogen evolution rate (2.75 mu mol L-1 h(-1)) compared to that by an unamended NZVI (6.92 mu mol L-1 h(-1)), indicating that sulfidation of NZVI suppressed corrosion reactions with water. Sulfide (HS-) ions reacted rapidly with NZVI and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses showed formation of a surface layer of FeS and FeS2. We propose that more electrons are preferentially conducted from sulfidated NZVI than from unamended NZVI to TCE, likely because of greater binding of TCE on the reactive sites of the iron sulfide outer layer. Resuspending sulfidated NZVI in sulfide-free or sulfide containing solutions altered the TCE degradation rate constants because of changes in the FeS layer thickness. Sulfidated NZVI maintained its high reactivity in the presence of multiple mono and divalent ions and with polyelectrolyte coatings. Thus, sulfide ions in groundwater can significantly alter NZVI reactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
